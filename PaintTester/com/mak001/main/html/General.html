				This is a program made by mak001 to help design paints for Powerbot scripts. Although it is far from a replica, it is based off of  <a href="http://www.powerbot.org/community/topic/180910-tool-enfilades-easel-paint-maker-version-2-making-paints-just-got-even-easier/">Enfilade's Easel</a>.
				You can code and test a paint with this program, although it is advised to use an official IDE to code the paint. 
			</p>

				<a name="where_start">Not sure where to start?</a>
			</div>

				The <img src="add.png" alt="plus"/> button in the code frame will add a new tab that can be used to write a class. The first time the button is pressed it will generate code to look like a skeleton of a script. There can only be one script skeleton per project.
			</p>
			<p class="p">
				After clicking the plus button a pop up will appear asking what you want to name your class. It can be anything, but things that are predefined in Java like modifiers and primitives although classes are an exception(no classes named int, but you could name one ArrayList).
			</p>
			<p class="p">
				The tab that appears will have the name of the class written on it and will have a <img src="remove.png" alt=" X with a circle around it"/>.
				This will remove the tab from the code frame, but will not completely get rid of the tab.
				See <a href="local/Edit#open_closed">Edit -> Open a closed file</a> for more information.
